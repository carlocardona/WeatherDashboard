# WeatherDashboard - Assignment 6 - https://carlocardona.github.io/WeatherDashboard/

Here is a weather dashboard, showing the current weather information in the top right section of the screen. 

For this assignment we are learning how to use API's. 

I utilized two API's for this assignement, listed below. 

1. https://openweathermap.org/current

2. https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api

At the bottom right you will then see a 5 day forecast. 

Buttons for the previous searches are then created on the left hand side of the page. 

When buttons are pressed it will present the weather information.
